# üõçÔ∏è Dealora ‚Äì Group Discount Shopping Platform

# Description

Dealora enables a unique ‚ÄúJoin to Unlock‚Äù experience for shoppers. Each product can have a group discount condition set by the seller (e.g., "50 people must join"). When enough buyers join, the discount is applied, and the product is automatically sold to all in the queue.

The platform includes seller/buyer login, product catalog browsing, cart and checkout functionality, and queue-based logic‚Äîall backed by a MongoDB database.
